    <h3>What is Digital Marketing?</h3>
    <p>Basically, digital marketing refers to any online marketing efforts or assets. Email marketing, pay-per-click advertising, social media marketing and even blogging are all great examples of digital marketing—they help introduce people to your company and convince them to buy. <br>

        Here are some of the most common digital marketing assets and strategies businesses use to reach people online:</p>
<h4>Digital Marketing Assets</h4>
<p>Almost anything can be a digital marketing asset. 
    It simply needs to be a marketing tool you use online. That being said, many people don’t realize how many digital marketing assets they have at their disposal. 
    Here are just a few examples:
    <ul>
        <li>Your website</li>
        <li>Branded assets (logos, icons, acronyms, etc)</li>
        <li>Video content (video ads, product demos, etc)</li>
        <li>Images (infographics, product shots, company photos, etc)</li>
        <li>Written content (blog posts, eBooks, product descriptions, testimonials, etc)</li>
        <li>Online products or tools (SaaS, calculators, interactive content, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <header> <h3>Does Digital Marketing Work?</h3></header>
    <p>Digital marketing is a great option for any business. At Disruptive, we’ve used digital marketing to help all kinds of businesses grow—from mom-and-pop shops to internationally recognized universities and beyond. That’s the beauty of advertising online. If you know who you want to target, you can use digital marketing to target anyone, anywhere.

    </p>
    <p>
        However, that being said, certain types of businesses will benefit more from certain types of digital advertising. As a quick overview, let’s take a look at which strategies tend to work best for business-to-consumer (B2C) companies and business-to-business (B2B) companies:
    </p>

    <h4>B2C Companies</h4>
    <p>
        Generally speaking, B2C companies have much lower price points than their B2B counterparts. After all, it can be a little hard to sell a $150,000 drill bit (believe me, they exist) to a harried mom. But a $10 pair of kids pants? That’s a fairly straightforward sell. <br>
        The good news is, because B2C companies aren’t trying to sell incredibly expensive products or services, they don’t need big sales teams or complicated marketing funnels. All they have to do is get their products or services in front of the right audience with the right messaging and the rest should take care of itself.
    </p>
    <h5>B2B Companies</h5>
    <p>
        In contrast, paid search is a great option for B2B companies. Most B2B companies have very specific niche audiences that can be hard to target using social media. However, if you sell $150,000 drill bits and someone searches for “diamond-tipped oil drilling bit manufacturer”, you want to be the first result they see. Yes, you might pay more for your click than you would with paid social advertising, but with a $150,000 price tag, it’s money well spent. <br>
        In addition, most B2B companies have a much longer and more involved sales cycle than B2C companies. If you’re selling a $150,000 drill bit, most people probably don’t come to your site, give you a call and say “I want one.” As a result, longer-term strategies like content marketing or email marketing are often necessary to close a deal.

    <header><h3>How is Digital Marketing Different on Mobile?</h3></header>
    <p>As you can probably imagine, digital marketing on mobile is very different from digital marketing on desktop. These days, these differences are particularly important because smartphones are now the primary device people use to interact with the internet. <br>
        To be honest, in today’s digital marketing world, it’s a good idea to assume that people will encounter your marketing on mobile and then adapt your strategy for desktop as needed. <br>

        In addition to optimizing your ads for mobile, it’s also important to think about your site and landing page experience. Sure, your website might look beautiful on desktop, but if it’s impossible to navigate on mobile, you’ll end up alienating a significant percentage of your web traffic.

    <header><h3>Coding Skills That Will Elevate Your Digital Marketing Career</h3></header>
    <p>
        Basic programming skills make a great supplement to marketing knowledge. They will help you be more effective at your work by giving you a better understanding of the capabilities of technology. We’ve selected the five most critical coding skills a digital marketer should equip themselves with to guarantee career longevity and future success. <br>
        Here are the 5 programming skills we think all digital marketers should learn:
        <ul>
            <li>Html</li>
            <li>Scriptiig</li>
            <li>Data Analysis</li>
            <li>Data Visualisation</li>
        </ul>
          <h4>HTML</h4> <br>
          HTML tells the web browser how it should define and display content. For content marketing, it is essential to understand how to find and edit meta descriptions, title tags and keywords. If the software you use to upload content lacks a Markdown or WYSIWYG interface, for good formatting it’s useful to learn how to create hyperlinks, headings, paragraphs and spacing, images and lists (and consider upgrading). <br>
          When working with HTML, we use simple code structures (tags and attributes) to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a <strong>(p)</strong> tag.  <br>        like this: <br>
         
          <code>
&lt;p&gt;This is how you add a paragraph in HTML.&lt;/p&gt; <br>
&lt;p&gt;You can have more than one!&lt;/p&gt;
        </code> <br>
Another html elements are as follows: <br>
<code>
    &lt;h1&gt; this is a heading &lt;/h1&gt;
</code> <br>
<code>
    &lt;br&gt;a line break &lt;/br&gt; etc

</code> <br>
We also have Html acottributes like : <br>
    <code>
    &lt;style&gt; style attribute <br>
    </code> 
    <code>
        &lt;title&gt; title attribute
    </code>
   
    <h4>Scripting</h4>
    This could be Bash, Python or even Perl. Bash is a command line interpreter, Python is a dynamic language, while Perl is general purpose. All of them support scripts — programs written to automate tasks that could also be executed manually by a human. <br>
    There are many things you can do with basic scripting ability. You can automate the taks that Zapier or IFTT can’t take care of. You can quickly build prototypes of internal tools to assess effectiveness before farming out to a dev. You can quickly clean data for data visualisation and analysis tools. Python regex is more extensive than Excel search and replace. <br>
   <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
   This is SQL & Excel. SQL is a programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system. They have data definition, manipulation and control languages. As a marketer, you would be using the manipulation language, or querying. Excel (or Libreoffice Calc) are spreadsheet programs with data manipulation function. Using those may require you to learn VBA or Python to run macros, which are rules that specify how an input sequence should be mapped to a replacement output sequence. <br>
   It’s a good idea to learn how to manipulate data in at least one of these. Learn how to query SQL, or if it’s just too text heavy for you, macros. However, SQL is able to handle more data and more complex queries. When you start to learn data analysis you’ll start to look after your data collection processes more carefully, and develop basic skills. <br>
   This means that when you bring in developers to do analysis, you’ll be able to ask better questions about what you want to know, and save both of you from having to spend most of the budget on cleaning data. Having basic skills in this also makes report writing easier, as you don’t have to wait for a developer to answer starter questions for you. You can pull raw data from your sales records, marketing automation and analysis tools and get to work.

   <h4>Data Visualisation</h4>
   Data visualisation is the presentation of information in a graphical format, usually a chart, sometimes a pictorial representation. They enable decision makers to see analytics visually and draw conclusions at a glance. They can convey a lot of information in a relatively small amount of screen real estate. <br>
   If you understand how to create data visualisations, you will be able to convey to stakeholders more easily what you want to do, and avoid things getting lost in translation. Data visualisation is also useful for content marketing, if you want to create a graphic to illustrate an argument, and making dynamic reports for information sources where that isn’t already provided for you.
